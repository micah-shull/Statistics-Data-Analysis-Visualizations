## **Why Statistics and Visualization Matter**
Statistics and data visualization are at the heart of modern data science, serving complementary roles:
- **Statistics** provides the mathematical framework for understanding data distributions, variability, and relationships.
- **Visualizations** transform numbers into narratives, making insights more accessible and actionable.

Together, they enable you to:
- **Explore Data:** Identify key patterns and anomalies.
- **Validate Findings:** Test hypotheses with statistical rigor.
- **Communicate Results:** Present findings visually to drive decisions.

## **Key Features of This Repository**

### **1. Summary Statistics**
Learn how to summarize datasets with:
- **Central Tendency Measures:** Mean, median, mode.
- **Variability Metrics:** Standard deviation, variance, and interquartile range (IQR).
- **Visual Tools:** Boxplots, histograms, and density plots for intuitive understanding.

### **2. Hypothesis Testing**
Master statistical techniques for determining the significance of your findings:
- **T-Tests (One-sample, Two-sample, Paired).**
- **ANOVA and Post-Hoc Tests.**
- **Chi-Square Tests and Proportion Z-Tests.**
- **Levene’s Test for Variance Equality.**

### **3. Data Visualization**
Develop compelling visuals to communicate insights effectively:
- **Comparative Plots:** Boxplots and bar charts to compare groups.
- **Distributions:** Density plots to explore data shape and variability.
- **Relationships:** Scatterplots and correlation heatmaps for feature interactions.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Pairplots and multi-feature visualizations.

### **4. Real-World Applications**
Work with diverse datasets like the Iris dataset, Titanic data, and California housing to:
- Illustrate practical applications of statistics and visualization.
- Provide actionable examples for business, research, and analytics contexts.
